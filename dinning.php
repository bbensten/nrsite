It is unusual for us to serve something that isn't truly "home-made". We seek out fresh produce and the finest cuts of meat, and support our local growers. Our chefs also fulfill many special food requests like vegetarian, vegan or kosher meals and avoid food allergies.</p>

<p>We kick off the day with a full breakfast. Afternoon tea and hors d'oeuvres keep the hungry skiers at bay while we prepare a sumptuous 3-course dinner.&nbsp;Optional soup-lunch can be served in the chalet for $25/person.</p>

<p>In a typical five-seven&nbsp;night package, two dinners are not included offering you a chance to eat-out in the resort. No visit would be complete without a sampling of the nightlife, ranging from pubs and casual dining to a horse drawn sleigh-ride at a private cabin on the mountain. We'll make restaurant reservations according to your preference (this is at your own expense). We can provide additional dinners in the Chalet for a small supplement as well.</p>

<p>Below are some typical menu items we would offer:</p>

<p><strong>Breakfast</strong><br>
Home-made mountain granola, selection of fresh fruit, farmhouse eggs, buckwheat pancakes,&nbsp;fresh brewed coffee, etc.</p>

<p><strong>Afternoon Tea</strong><br>
Freshley baked cookies, bars and cakes.</p>

<p><strong>Hors d'Oeuvres</strong><br>
Charcuterie platter, beer braised pork carnitas wrap, lump crab cakes, scallop Carpaccio, black pepper seared tuna, etc.</p>

<p><strong>Dinner</strong><br>
Butternet squash soup, brussel sprouts and fig salad, short ribs, elk medallions, rib-eye steak, wild-caught salmon, beef stew, etc.</p>

<p><strong>Dessert</strong><br>
Hazelnut brown butter brownies, flourless chocolate torte, caramelized apple tartlets, lemon cheesecake, etc.</p>          </div>
